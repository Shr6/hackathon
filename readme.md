# 🌊 IoT-Based Real-Time Flood Detection System

An intelligent, Arduino-powered flood monitoring system with real-time data visualization, Flask-based web dashboard, historical logging, and CSV export capabilities for analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to **monitor potential flood risks in real time** using an Arduino-connected water level sensor. The system collects data, sends it to a **Flask-powered backend**, stores it in a database, and displays live readings through a responsive **Tailwind CSS web interface**.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Real-time flood detection** via Arduino sensors.
- 🌐 **Live dashboard** built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js.
- 📊 **Data visualization** of flood trends and history.
- 🧠 **Flask backend API** for receiving and storing Arduino sensor data.
- 📁 **Export sensor data** to CSV for further analysis.
- 🔔 Optional: Instant alert system via SMS/email.
